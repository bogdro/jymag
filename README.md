# JYMAG #

JYMAG (Jig Your Music and Graphics) - a program for communicating with
mobile phones.

Its main functionality is retrieving and sending multimedia and other
objects from and to AT-based phones or devices, like a Sagem mobile phone
(tested on Linux with a "Sagem MY X5-2").

JYMAG can also be used with other phones and devices (modems) and serve as
a general-purpose serial port terminal or a Java library for programmers.

Program's website is available at <https://jymag.sourceforge.io>.
