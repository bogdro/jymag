<p>
This is the main window of the JYMAG program. It allows you to perform many different operations.
Use the font size spinner at the top of the window to adjust the font size of this window
and all windows opened from this window.
</p>
<p>
On the top left side of the window you can set the communication port's parameters:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>The Port list allows you to select which communication port to use.
	If you don't know which port to use, press the "Scan ports" button.
	When scanning is finished, the port that replied is automatically selected
	or you're presented with a list to choose from. In any case, you can always select
	another port. Choosing different ports allows you to see which port have replied
	with what information - this information is shown using the four labels in the
	middle section of the window.<br><br>
	If your port is not on the list, check if:<br><br>
   <ul>
    <li>the phone connects with a serial link (not as a USB mass storage device,
     for example)</li>
    <li>you have installed a correct driver for the cable/IrDA/other devices</li>
    <li>the phone's port is not already in use</li>
    <li>you have the newest RxTx</li>
   </ul><br></li>
 <li>The Speed list allows you to choose the transmission speed. Set this to the value set
	in the phone (or other device you're connecting to) or leave the default 115200.
	<br><br></li>
 <li>Choose the number of data bits to use: 8 (the recommended default), 7, 6 or 5.
	<br><br></li>
 <li>Choose the parity checking: None (the recommended default), Even, Odd, Space, Mark.
	<br><br></li>
 <li>Choose the number of stop bits: 1 (the recommended default), 1.5 or 2.
	<br><br></li>
 <li>Choose the flow control mode: None (both checkboxes deselected - the recommended default),
	Software or Hardware.
	<br><br></li>
</ol>
Below the port's settings there are two buttons:
<ol>
 <li>"Load configuration" allows you to load your settings from a previously-saved
	JYMAG configuration file.<br><br></li>
 <li>"Save configuration" allows you to save your settings to a file. The following settings
	are saved:<br><br>
	<ul>
	 <li>port name</li>
	 <li>port speed setting</li>
	 <li>port data bits setting</li>
	 <li>port parity setting</li>
	 <li>port stop bits setting</li>
	 <li>port flow control setting</li>
	 <li>main window position</li>
	 <li>main window size and whether is was maximized or not</li>
	 <li>main window font size</li>
	</ul><br></li>
</ol>

Below, in the middle section of the window are the following elements:
<ol>
 <li>The phone type label - contains the phone type returned by the phone (if any) after
	you have pressed "Scan ports".
	<br><br></li>
 <li>The phone's firmware version returned by the phone (if any) after
	you have pressed "Scan ports".
	<br><br></li>
 <li>The phone's IMEI number returned by the phone (if any) after
	you have pressed "Scan ports".
	<br><br></li>
 <li>The subscriber number of the currently-inserted SIM card returned by the phone (if any) after
	you have pressed "Scan ports". This is simply your phone number.
	<br><br></li>
 <li>The program status label tells if the program is ready for your command, receiving or
	sending data.
	<br><br></li>
 <li>The progress bar shows the progress of the current operation.
	<br><br></li>
</ol>

At the bottom of the main window there is a panel with tabs. These tabs contain tables with
 the files or other elements found in the phone:
<ul>
 <li>pictures/photographs</li>
 <li>ringtones/melodies/music files</li>
 <li>addressbook (phonebook) entries</li>
 <li>to-do tasks</li>
 <li>events/tasks</li>
 <li>animation/videos/movies</li>
 <li>Java elements</li>
 <li>alarm clock entries</li>
 <li>SMS messages</li>
</ul>

More information can be found on the <a href="tables.html" hreflang="en">tabs' page</a>.

<br><br>

Finally, on the right side of the window you can find the following buttons:
<ol>
 <li>"Scan ports" - press this to scan the found serial ports for replies.
	When scanning is finished, the port that replied is automatically selected
	or you're presented with a list to choose from. In any case, you can always select
	another port. Choosing different ports allows you to see which port have replied
	with what information - this information is shown using the four labels in the
	middle section of the window.
