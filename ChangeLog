	  Catching Throwables in the method.

	  GZIP, ZIP/JAR, some MPEG audio including MP3s, WMV, XML/SVG/anything
	  that starts with "<!DOCTYPE", midlets' JAD files.

	  the Esc key works. Changed JPanels to JScrollPanes, so the users can
	  scroll them if not all GUI elements are visible. Fixed a bug when
	  "ATIMEI" was displayed instead of the phone type. Added a button
	  which opens a window where you can check the phone's capabilities.
	  Added a possibility to load and save the current configuration
	  (port and main window settings). Fixed refreshing the phone type
	  and firmware labels after next scans. Added a default exception
	  handler for threads, so hopefully every important exception will get
	  logged into the log file. Added a '--lang' command-line option which
	  allows to set the language used by JYMAG. Changed the flow control combo
	  to two checkboxes, to allow both software and hardware flow control. The

	  Allowing downloading of WBMP images and MNG animations. Allowing deleting
	  animations.
	* AboutBox: a new class displaying the "About..." window with author,
	  www, license and thanks info. The links are clickable and do the
	  expected things (almost).
	* MainWindow.java: The download button now displays a "Save" dialog
	  instead of "Open". Clicking on any table header selects all rows.
	  Deleting: setting the status to "sending" just once. Renamed
	  "Events" to "Events/Tasks". Added supported file extensions to
	  upload-mode file choosers. Added different background colours for
	  different tabs. The current elements are now local to prevent data
	  inconsistency. Added a progress bar. Making all available port
	  speeds visible at the same time. Added a phone-type label and receiving
	  phone type when "Scan" is pressed. Added the program version to the
	  title bar. A new tab for animations/videos. Added an "Exit" button.
	* package "gfx" renamed to "rsrc" (because the license file was added,
	  the package is not only-graphics anymore).
	* Utils.java: added the magic numbers for TO-DOs (thus also for the
	  events as they are the same), addressbook files, WBMP images, MNG
	  animations/videos. Corrected exception displaying. Added a new file
	  extension (*.vcrd) for vCards.
	* RawCommunicator.java: The command field now expands along with the
	  window. Empty response won't add an empty new line in the response
	  area. After sending the command, the focus returns to the
	  command-typing area.
	* DataTransporter.java: Fixed saving unknown files (too many bytes were
	  written). Added the WBMP header and the MNG header. Added a check if the
	  port still exists when trying to open (this doesn't check "COM*" ports,
	  because I don't know if it would work). Had to do it, because when a
	  port disappears (unplugged etc.), RxTx crashes the program.

	  the current program state. A new label with the currently selected
	  phone's firmware version. File choosing windows now all remember the
