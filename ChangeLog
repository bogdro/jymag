	  instead of Strings. Now downloading also non-Sagem photos. Better
	  checking for transmission end. Better waiting for data.
	* DataTransporter.java (putFile): better transmission restarting.

	  from the file name: dots, commas, parenthesis, braces, brackets,
	  colons and many more.

	  about downloaded elements being sometimes corrupted and a note about
	  how to report errors.
	* MainWindow.java: added icons for the tabs. Redirect standard error
	  stream to a file to save exceptions for easier bug reporting. Using
	  SwingWorker threads to do long-lasting background jobs, so that the

	  the current program state. A new label with the currently selected
