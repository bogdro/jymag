	* JYMAG version 0.6:
	  Moving listeners to private inner classes and minimizing the number
	  of publicly-available methods. Allowing uploading of addressbook
	  entries, to-do entries, events/tasks, WBMP images, MNG animations. New
	  icons for download and upload. Downloading the list of animations/videos.
	  Allowing downloading of WBMP images and MNG animations. Allowing deleting
	  animations.
	* AboutBox: a new class displaying the "About..." window with author,
	  www, license and thanks info. The links are clickable and do the
	  expected things (almost).
	* MainWindow.java: The download button now displays a "Save" dialog
	  instead of "Open". Clicking on any table header selects all rows.
	  Deleting: setting the status to "sending" just once. Renamed
	  "Events" to "Events/Tasks". Added supported file extensions to
	  upload-mode file choosers. Added different background colours for
	  different tabs. The current elements are now local to prevent data
	  inconsistency. Added a progress bar. Making all available port
	  speeds visible at the same time. Added a phone-type label and receiving
	  phone type when "Scan" is pressed. Added the program version to the
	  title bar. A new tab for animations/videos. Added an "Exit" button.
	* package "gfx" renamed to "rsrc" (because the license file was added,
	  the package is not only-graphics anymore).
	* Utils.java: added the magic numbers for TO-DOs (thus also for the
	  events as they are the same), addressbook files, WBMP images, MNG
	  animations/videos. Corrected exception displaying. Added a new file
	  extension (*.vcrd) for vCards.
	* RawCommunicator.java: The command field now expands along with the
	  window. Empty response won't add an empty new line in the response
	  area. After sending the command, the focus returns to the
	  command-typing area.
	* DataTransporter.java: Fixed saving unknown files (too many bytes were
	  written). Added the WBMP header and the MNG header. Added a check if the
	  port still exists when trying to open (this doesn't check "COM*" ports,
	  because I don't know if it would work). Had to do it, because when a
	  port disappears (unplugged etc.), RxTx crashes the program.

	* JYMAG version 0.5:
	* DataTransporter.java: Better contents matching using byte arrays
	  instead of Strings. Now downloading also non-Sagem photos. Better
	  checking for transmission end. Better waiting for data.
	* DataTransporter.java (putFile): better transmission restarting.
	* PhoneElement.java (getFilename): removing more unwanted characters
	  from the file name: dots, commas, parenthesis, braces, brackets,
	  colons and many more.
	* README: added a note in case the program doesn't start, a note
	  about downloaded elements being sometimes corrupted and a note about
	  how to report errors.
	* MainWindow.java: added icons for the tabs. Redirect standard error
	  stream to a file to save exceptions for easier bug reporting. Using
	  SwingWorker threads to do long-lasting background jobs, so that the
	  GUI remains respondive. Central exception handling. A new label with
	  the current program state. A new label with the currently selected
	  phone's firmware version. File choosing windows now all remember the
	  last used directory. More upload error messgaes, reflecting the changes
	  in file upload. Changed download dialog box to "save" type.
	* Utils.java: a new utility class containig some useful methods and
	  fields.
