	* JYMAG version 0.9:
	  Each window is now in a ScrollPane, so if the contents is too big
	  to fit, scroll bars are shown. Each window now has a font size
	  spinner to allow easy changing the font size for the user. Run
	  jlint on the code and fixed some problems.
	* MainWindow.java (MainWindow, loadConfButActionPerformed): verifying
	  window size and position for the window to be visible.
	* MainWindow.java (downloadButActionPerformed): Better exception
	  messages on failed transfers.
	* ConfigFile.java: reading and saving the font size.
	* DataTransporter.java: added methods for powering off the phone,
	  telling which PIN number is the phone waiting for (if any) and for
	  sending that PIN number. These methods are unverified. Moved
	  transport-realted code from MainWindow and CapabilityWindow to this
	  class. Added methods for getting the number of supported alarms,
	  getting the list of currently-enabled alarms, adding new alarms and
	  deleting alarms.
	* PhoneAlarm.java: a new class represning alarm clocks/times.
	* MainWindow.java: support for getting list of, updating and deleting
	  phone alarms.
	* Starter.java: fixed the startup error message displaying.

	* JYMAG version 0.8:
	  Fix for downloading non-Sagem JPG files. Unchecked downloading of CGM
	  (the most common CGM types, at least), WMF and PMB files. Displaying
	  the IMEI and subscriber phone numbers and additional phone type.
	* DataTransporter.java (getFile): the second match in a double match
	  in JPG files' downloading now has to end with 0xFF, this fixes some
	  problems with non-Sagem photos. Unchecked downloading of CGM, WMF
	  and PMB files.
	* ConfigFile.java (read): more friendly error messages in exceptions.
	* ConfigFile.java: Patterns are now case-insensitive. Other minor
	  fixes and enhancements.
	* MainWindow.java (downloadButActionPerformed): separate the filename
	  from the "exists" message with a space.
	* README: updates in build instructions, other small fixes.
	* MainWindow, CapabilityWindow, DataTransporter, RawCommunicator:
	  synchronizing only on final fields.
	* AboutBox.java: change e-mail subject
	* MainWindow.java: perform prepare operations on the file choosers just
	  once. If configuration file says the window wasn't maximized,
	  unmaximize it, to allow position and size changes. Use Locale.ENGLISH
	  in String.toLowerCase(). Displaying the IMEI and subscriber phone
	  numbers and additional phone type. Catching Throwables when trying
	  to launch new windows.
	* PhoneElement (getExt): use Locale.ENGLISH in String.toLowerCase().
	* DataTransporter.java (putFile): use Locale.ENGLISH in
	  String.toLowerCase().
	* Utils.java: updated initial size of ringfileIDs.
	* Starter.java: a new main class that tries to launch the program or
	  displays an error to the user.

	* JYMAG version 0.7:
	  Verified uploading of AMR ringtones.
	  Unchecked uploading of: IMY, ASG1, ASG2, EMS_GR, EMS_AN, SSA,
	  MJPG, MP3, MFI, AAC, AWB, TIFF, PICT, AI, EPS, PS, SG1, SG2, AVI,
	  MP4, MPEG, MPG, 3GP, 3GPP, 3G2, JAR, JAD, JAM. Added JIF as an alias
	  for JPEG, VCS as an alias for ICS, M4A as an alias for AAC.
	  Added internationalization (i18n) support and Polish localization. Moved
	  the resources to a package BogDroSoft.jymag.rsrc, under BogDroSoft.jymag.
	* Utils.java (handleException): allow Throwables, not only Exceptions.
	  Catching Throwables in the method.
	* Utils.java: Added a Hashtable for Java files.
	* DataTransporter.java: better JPG downloading (relying only on two
	  header bytes; this should allow downloading Exif and MJPEG files),
	  added unchecked downloading of: AIFF, IMY, AAC (MPEG4-AAC), MPEG4,
	  GZIP, ZIP/JAR, some MPEG audio including MP3s, WMV, XML/SVG/anything
	  that starts with "<!DOCTYPE", midlets' JAD files.
	* MainWindow.java: added key listeners to Animation/Video tab, so that
	  the Esc key works. Changed JPanels to JScrollPanes, so the users can
	  scroll them if not all GUI elements are visible. Fixed a bug when
	  "ATIMEI" was displayed instead of the phone type. Added a button
	  which opens a window where you can check the phone's capabilities.
	  Added a possibility to load and save the current configuration
	  (port and main window settings). Fixed refreshing the phone type
	  and firmware labels after next scans. Added a default exception
	  handler for threads, so hopefully every important exception will get
	  logged into the log file. Added a '--lang' command-line option which
	  allows to set the language used by JYMAG. Changed the flow control combo
	  to two checkboxes, to allow both software and hardware flow control. The
	  '--help' option now displays the command-line options in alphabetical
	  order. Added a '--conf' option to read configuration from a file at
	  startup. New upload and download icons. New program icon.
	* ConfigFile.java: a new class for dealing with configuration file
	  loading and saving.
	* README: upgrade and fixes
	* PhoneElement.java (getExt): added more extensions.
	* run.sh, run.bat: path corrections and upgrade.
	* run-en.sh, run-en.bat: these files allow running the program in
	  English, no matter what the system language is.

2008-08-13	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* JYMAG version 0.6:
	  Moving listeners to private inner classes and minimizing the number
	  of publicly-available methods. Allowing uploading of addressbook
	  entries, to-do entries, events/tasks, WBMP images, MNG animations. New
	  icons for download and upload. Downloading the list of animations/videos.
	  Allowing downloading of WBMP images and MNG animations. Allowing deleting
	  animations.
	* AboutBox: a new class displaying the "About..." window with author,
	  www, license and thanks info. The links are clickable and do the
	  expected things (almost).
	* MainWindow.java: The download button now displays a "Save" dialog
	  instead of "Open". Clicking on any table header selects all rows.
	  Deleting: setting the status to "sending" just once. Renamed
	  "Events" to "Events/Tasks". Added supported file extensions to
	  upload-mode file choosers. Added different background colours for
	  different tabs. The current elements are now local to prevent data
	  inconsistency. Added a progress bar. Making all available port
	  speeds visible at the same time. Added a phone-type label and receiving
	  phone type when "Scan" is pressed. Added the program version to the
	  title bar. A new tab for animations/videos. Added an "Exit" button.
	* package "gfx" renamed to "rsrc" (because the license file was added,
	  the package is not only-graphics anymore).
	* Utils.java: added the magic numbers for TO-DOs (thus also for the
	  events as they are the same), addressbook files, WBMP images, MNG
	  animations/videos. Corrected exception displaying. Added a new file
	  extension (*.vcrd) for vCards.
	* RawCommunicator.java: The command field now expands along with the
	  window. Empty response won't add an empty new line in the response
	  area. After sending the command, the focus returns to the
	  command-typing area.
	* DataTransporter.java: Fixed saving unknown files (too many bytes were
	  written). Added the WBMP header and the MNG header. Added a check if the
	  port still exists when trying to open (this doesn't check "COM*" ports,
	  because I don't know if it would work). Had to do it, because when a
	  port disappears (unplugged etc.), RxTx crashes the program.

	  about downloaded elements being sometimes corrupted and a note about
	  how to report errors.

	  stream to a file to save exceptions for easier bug reporting. Using
	  SwingWorker threads to do long-lasting background jobs, so that the
	  GUI remains respondive. Central exception handling. A new label with
	  the current program state. A new label with the currently selected
	  phone's firmware version. File choosing windows now all remember the
	  last used directory. More upload error messgaes, reflecting the changes
	  in file upload. Changed download dialog box to "save" type.
	* Utils.java: a new utility class containig some useful methods and
	  fields.
