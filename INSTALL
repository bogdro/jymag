Copy JYMAG/dist/JYMAG.jar and run.sh to one directory in  a suitable location
 (like in your PATH). Running "run.sh" will be enough. The "java" binary
 must be in your $PATH variable.

Under Windows, a duble click on the JAR file should be enough. If not, copy
 JYMAG/dist/JYMAG.jar and run.bat to one directory in a suitable location
 (like in your PATH). Running "run.bat" will be enough.
 When using the second approach, the "java.exe" binary must be
 in your PATH variable too.
