Copy JYMAG/dist/JYMAG.jar and run.sh to a suitable location
 (like in your PATH). Running "run.sh" will be enough.

Under Windows, a duble click on the JAR file should be enough. If not, copy
 JYMAG/dist/JYMAG.jar and run.bat to a suitable location
 (like in your PATH). Running "run.bat" will be enough.
 When using the second approach, the "java.exe" binary must be
 in your PATH too.
