This is the README file for JYMAG (Java Your Music and Graphics), a program
 for retrieving multimedia from a Sagem mobile phone (tested on Linux with
 "Sagem MY X5-2").

========================= Running

Using NetBeans: open the JYMAG folder as a NetBeans Project
 and hit "Run".

By hand:
	java -jar JYMAG/dist/JYMAG.jar

========================= Compiling (if necessary)

Requirements for compiling:

- JDK, the Java Development Kit >= (1.)6.0

- RxTx Java Transmission package from www.rxtx.org

Compiling using NetBeans: open the JYMAG folder as a NetBeans Project
 and hit "Build Main Project".

Compiling by hand: try
	cd JYMAG/src/BogDroSoft/jymag/
	java *.java

========================= Using

Phone setup: conecct it to the computer using a cable or IrDA or
 whatever works. Switch the transmission on. If using a cable, select
 Automatic speed in the configuration.

No need to connect to the phone. Start by selecting the tab you're
 interested in (photos, ringtones, ...). Click on "Get list" to connect
 to the phone and get the list of elements. Select the elements you wish
 to download and click "Download selected". The downloaded files will
 show up in the JYMAG program's folder.

========================= Currently supported operations:

1) Getting lists of: pictures and ringtones
2) Downloading:
   a) pictures: JPG
   b) ringtones: MIDI, AMR
3) Uploading:
   a) pictures: JPG, GIF, BMP, PNG
   b) ringtones: MIDI

========================= Converting ringtones

Some ringtones received from the phone may be in AMR format. You can
 convert those to other formats using other software, like the free
 "Mobile Media Converter". If it doesn't work, use the FFMPEG program
 attached to the "Mobile Media Converter" like this:

 ffmpeg -i Ring.amr -ar 44100 Ring.wav

========================= If not working

1. If the phone's port doesn't show up on the list.
   Not JYMAG's fault. Make sure:
   - you have installed a correct driver for the cable/IrDA/other devices
   - the phone's port is not already in use
   - you have the newest RxTx

2. Getting the list(s) fails.
   Click "Scan ports". If an answer is received, the correct port should be
   selected in the combo box. If not, an error will show up. Try closing
   the program and starting it at least 3 more times. If no success, check
   your drivers and connection. If the program crashes (missing icon),
   select your port manually.

3. Getting the list(s) or scanning hangs the program.
   Try a few times. I've tried to limit the waiting time, but my method
   apparently doesn't work all the time.
