This is the README file for JYMAG (Jig Your Music and Graphics), a program
 for communicating with mobile phones.
JYMAG's main functionality is retrieving and sending multimedia and other
 objects from and to AT-based phones or devices, like a Sagem mobile phone
 (tested on Linux with a "Sagem MY X5-2").
JYMAG can also be used with other phones and devices (modems) and serve as
 a general-purpose serial port terminal or a Java library for programmers.

Program's website is available at https://jymag.sourceforge.io.

========================= Running

Requirements:
- RxTx Java Transmission package from either:
	* https://github.com/rxtx/rxtx
	* http://fizzed.com/oss/rxtx-for-java
	* http://rxtx.qbang.org
	* http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/download.html
  or any equivalent
- JRE, the Java SE Runtime Environment >= (1.)6.0
- permissions to use the serial ports
- port locking permissions may be required by RxTx. On Un*x, adding the user
  running JYMAG to the "uucp" and "lock" user groups should be enough. If not,
  add write permissions to the /var/lock directory.

Using Apache NetBeans: open the JYMAG directory as a NetBeans Project
 and click "Run" (or press F6).

By hand (after unpacking):
	double-click the JYMAG\dist\JYMAG.jar file (works on MS Windows)
		or
	run.bat	(on MS Windows)
		or
	run.sh	(on Un*x)
		or
	java -jar JYMAG/dist/JYMAG.jar	(on Un*x)
		or
	java -jar JYMAG\dist\JYMAG.jar	(on MS Windows)

Read the "INSTALL" file.

========================= Usage (GUI)

Phone setup: connect it to the computer using a cable or IrDA or
 whatever works. Switch the transmission on in the phone, if necessary.
 If using a cable, select "Automatic speed" in the configuration.

No need to connect to the phone. Start by selecting the tab you're
 interested in (photos, ringtones, ...). Click on "Get list" to connect
 to the phone and get the list of elements. Select the elements you wish
 to download and click "Download selected". Choose the destination directory.
 The downloaded files will show up in selected location.
To upload an element, simply click the "Upload" button. Getting the
 list isn't necessary. You can also drag&drop the files you want to upload
 on any of the tables (except the alarms and SMS messages).
To edit an alarm, double click the cell in the table. Keep the format
 unchanged.
To read an SMS message, select it in the table and choose "Download selected".
 A new window will appear allowing you to read the message.
To send an SMS message, click the "Upload" button. A new window will appear,
 allowing you to type the phone number and the message body.

========================= Converting ringtones

Some ringtones received from the phone may be in AMR format. You can
 convert those to other formats using other software, like the free
 "Mobile Media Converter". If it doesn't work, use the FFMPEG program
 attached to the "Mobile Media Converter" like this:

 ffmpeg -i Ring.amr -ar 44100 Ring.wav

To convert a ringtone to a WAV format accepted by the phone, use the
 following command:

 ffmpeg -i <ringtone file> -ar 8000 -t 10 -ac 1
	-acodec adpcm_ima_wav <output file>.wav

(the number after "-t" is the ringtone duration in seconds). I've only been
able to upload ringtones created with the above command. It may be possible
to upload longer ringtones, in greater sampling rates, stereo, ..., but
I haven't tried all that (my 30-second ringtones are rejected).

You can also use IMYplay (https://imyplay.sourceforge.io/) to convert IMY
ringtones to sample files and then to WAV files.
